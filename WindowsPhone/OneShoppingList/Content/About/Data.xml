       ...then you need to override the 'Title' attribute of the 'App' node to provide the correct title explicitly here! -->
  <!-- The AdditionalNotes attribute has no equivalent in the WMAppManifest.xml; you can only define its content here -->

ONE SHOPPING LIST
Shopping List with shopping paths and multi-device sync through OneDrive.
From now on, you have only one shopping list to manage. It is sorted according to the store where you are currently shopping, so that the order on your list corresponds to your path through that store.

YOUR SHOPPING PATHS
Manage your stores: choose the available product categories and the order in which you encounter them on your way through the store.

OneDrive SYNC
Share your shopping list with your family.
The app will combine all the changes from all participating devices using a timestamp on product item level.
To activate this feature log in with your Microsoft account.
Make sure you use the same account on all devices you want to keep in sync.

AUTOCOMPLETE
One way to add items to your list is by typing a part of the product name and choosing from the list of matching items.
Use this function if some items you need to buy just came into your mind.

FAVORITES
The other way is to review the list of your preferred products and mark some of them to be added to the shopping list.
Use this function at home, before doing your weekend shopping, to check if you are out of some basic products.

SEND AS EMAIL
If your partner does not own a windows phone, send him/her an email with the sorted shopping list.

    <Item Title="history"
           Type="text">
      1.6.0.0
      This version fixes the OneDrive sync, which stopped working by end of December 2018.

      1.5.0.0
      Items which are not assigned to a shopping path can now be hidden. When shown, they are rendered dimmed.
      Basic error handling during sync, better handling when no network is available.
      Auto-Caps on the add items page.
      The name of the App in the Store and on your phone is changed to "Shopping List". Internal name is still One Shopping List.

      1.4.0.0
      This version only fixes the OneDrive sync, which stopped working by mid of july.

      1.1.0.0
      If everything goes well, this will be the first version visible in the windows phone store to all users. It contains:
      BUG FIXES:
      - an error related to the propagation of delete operations caused the app to crash during sync under certain circumstances.
      NEW FEATURES:
      - implemented an initial setup page, to guide the user after having installed the app.
      - shopping basket was remove completely, instead in the favorites page there is a "latest" pivot item.
      - some buttons and menu items where relocated to improve usability.

      1.0.0.3
      Bug Fixes:
      - Solves sync issue for deletion of products from the product list
      New Features:
      - When the app is closing and automatic sync is turned on, and there are local changes, sync is performed.
      - You can send the shopping list by email now.
      - About Box with help and version history.
      - The shopping basket is not saved anymore. The order of the items in the shopping basket is the same with the order in which you added them to the shopping basket. This makes it easier for you to find items which you moved to the shopping basket by mistake, and can move them back to the shopping list.
      - Animations when you move items to the shopping basket or from the shopping basket back to the shopping list.

      1.0.0.2
